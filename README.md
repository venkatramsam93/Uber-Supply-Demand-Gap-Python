# Uber-Supply-Demand-Gap-Python
An analysis of Uber's supply-demand using Request Data

# Problem Description
We all may have some experience of travelling to and from the airport and have used Uber or any other cab service to get to/from the airport. Users face a common problem of cancellation by the driver or non-availability of cars.

Well, if these are the problems faced by customers, these very issues also impact the business of Uber. If drivers cancel the request of riders or if cars are unavailable, Uber loses out on its revenue. A masked dataset comprising only of ride requests between City and Airport is used for this analysis.

# Dataset Features
1. Request ID
2. Driver ID
3. Pickup point (City/Airport)
4. Status (Trip Completed/Cancelled/No cars available)
5. Pickup timestamp
6. Drop timestamp (if completed)

# Objective
1. Visualize the demand from customers at different time-of-day in City & at airports.
2. Visualize the distribution of Completed/Cancelled/Unavailable rides
3. Visualize the inflow and outflow of cabs at airports at different time-of-day.
4. Visualizing supply-demand gap.
